Hello! I am Ramon Rodrigues and I am a full stack developer based in Brazil.

I am interested in learning and working with Web Programming, Artificial Intelligence, and IoT, using technologies and tools like Python, JavaScript, C, among others.

I am also interested in sharing knowledge, therefore I teach computer science through the Portuguese version of Harvard University's CS50 (https://cs50xemportugues.github.io).

If you want to reach to me, you can send an email to ramonfrombr@gmail.com.
